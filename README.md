# Self-Balancing Robot with Arduino Nano, MPU6050 & PID Control

This project implements a **self-balancing two-wheeled robot** using the **Arduino Nano**, **MPU6050 IMU (Gyroscope + Accelerometer)**, and a **PID control algorithm**.  
The robot maintains balance in real time by continuously adjusting motor speeds based on orientation feedback.  

In robotics, maintaining stability in small robots on uneven surfaces is a classic challenge.  
This project demonstrates how **low-cost hardware + well-tuned control theory** can solve it efficiently.

## Features
- Real-time balance control using **Arduino Nano + PID algorithm**.
- Dual PID loops: **Pitch control** for balance & **Yaw control** for rotation stability.
- **MPU6050 calibration utility** included for accurate motion sensing.
- **TT motors + L298N driver** for actuation.
- **Handmade chassis** built for testing in real-world uneven surfaces.
- Fritzing circuit layout (`.fzz` + `.png`) provided for easy hardware setup.

## Installation

Upload the provided Arduino sketches to your **Arduino Nano**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faisal-ajao/self-balancing-robot.git
cd self-balancing-robot

# Open in Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) and upload:
# - calibration_mpu6050/calibration_mpu6050.ino  (for calibration)
# - self-balancing-robot.ino                     (main control loop)
```

---

## Usage

1. **Calibrate MPU6050**  
   - Upload and run `calibration_mpu6050.ino`.  
   - Record the offsets printed in the Serial Monitor.  
   - These are automatically applied in `self-balancing-robot.ino`.  

2. **Run the Self-Balancing Robot**  
   - Upload `self-balancing-robot.ino` to the Arduino Nano.  
   - Place the robot upright and power it on.  
   - The PID controller will attempt to stabilize the robot in real time.
